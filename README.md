## Project Overview

Welcome to the GPT Data Assistant Platform, an innovative solution designed to democratize data querying and analysis for business and product personnel without technical expertise. Leveraging a robust integration of GPT models, our platform simplifies the process of generating SQL queries, Python scripts, PowerBI insights, and Databricks operations, making data-driven decision-making accessible to everyone.

### Key Features

- **Query Generation:** Automatically generates SQL, Python, and Databricks queries based on natural language input.
- **Data Analysis:** Provides insights and analysis suitable for PowerBI and other business intelligence tools.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, and Bootstrap for a seamless user experience.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Centralizes costs and streamlines data analysis processes.
- **Audit and Compliance:** Ensures queries are made against correct and updated datasets through stringent auditing.

### Why Choose GPT Data Assistant?

Not everyone is comfortable or technically capable of setting up their own ChatGPT assistant or managing datasets. The GPT Data Assistant removes these barriers, providing a centralized, user-friendly platform that requires no prior technical knowledge. This ensures all business users can make informed decisions anytime without waiting for data analyst availability.

### Future Goals

Our vision extends to direct integration with Databricks or your preferred data lake. This will enable real-time data retrieval and automatic file updates, further simplifying the data analysis process.

## How It Works

1. **User Input:** Users input their questions or data analysis requests in natural language.
2. **Query and Response Generation:** The system interprets the request, formulates appropriate queries, and retrieves data using advanced algorithms.
3. **Data Presentation:** Results are presented in an easy-to-understand format, supported by visual aids like graphs and tables when necessary.
